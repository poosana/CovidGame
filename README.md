Overview:
A human body is an m√ón field of cells, where m and n are as specified in the configuration file.  At each time unit, a virus can spawn at one of the empty cells.  After the time unit a virus has spawned, the virus will behave according to its genetic code.  A virus may be eliminated by an antibody, but can also harm an antibody.  It's a matter of survival!
